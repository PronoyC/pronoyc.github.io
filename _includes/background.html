      I'm currently a Computing and Financial Management Undergraduate at the
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://uwaterloo.ca/" target="_blank">University of Waterloo</a> learning how to create powerful code. I also run a pro-bono blockchain counsel firm called <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.blokify.me" target="_blank">Blokify Consulting</a>. 
      In addition, I have so far completed one four-month co-op at
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.wawanesa.com/canada/" target="_blank">Wawanesa Insurance</a>.

      As a full-stack developer, I enjoy bridging powerful back-end code with beautiful front-end design&mdash; combining my technical knowledge
      with my keen eye for design to create a beautiful product. My goal is to always build applications that are scalable
      and efficient under the hood while providing engaging, pixel-perfect user experiences. In addition, I love using blockchain technologies whenever possible, including Corda, Fabric, and Ethereum.

      <strong>When I'm not in front of a computer screen</strong>, I'm probably helping the Stack Overflow community, watching NBA games, or playing basketball myself.
