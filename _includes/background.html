      I'm currently a computing and financial management undergraduate at the
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://uwaterloo.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Waterloo</a> 
      (also pursuing a double minor in computational mathematics and combinatorics & optimization), learning how to create useful software 
      products. I have so far completed six internships at <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.wawanesa.com/canada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
      Wawanesa Insurance</a>, <a class="underline-link" href="https://www2.deloitte.com/ca/en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deloitte</a>, 
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.lcbonext.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LCBO</a>,

      As a <strong>product manager</strong>, I have an <strong>obsessive desire</strong> to design and ship <strong>amazing</strong> products. As any 
      cultured person, I use <strong>Agile</strong> for a smooth product development process, consistently acting as a liasion between 
      <strong>business, design, and development</strong> teams while juggling product roadmap drafts and a venti vanilla ice coffee. I pride myself 
      in being a collaborator <strong>&mdash; not a dictator</strong>, supporting my team and helping them grow while maintaining 
      tight deadlines. Being from a technical background, I am fluent in <strong>understanding tech-speak</strong> and through my 
      extensive UX experiences, I <strong>live and breathe user personas and journey maps</strong>. I always look for the simplest, cost-effective 
      solution that addresses user needs <strong>&mdash; even if it isn't technical</strong>.

      <strong>When I'm not developing or ideating</strong>, I'm probably writing 
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://medium.com/@pronoyc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an article on Medium</a>, 
      helping the Stack Overflow community, browsing Reddit, watching NBA games, or racking up some wins in Overwatch.
